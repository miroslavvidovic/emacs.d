# miroslavvidovic emacs configuration
This repository contains my personal Emacs configuration

## Installation
To install, clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, i.e. ensure that the `init.el` contained in this repo ends up at `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/miroslavvidovic/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```
When you start up Emacs for the first time, further third-party packages will be automatically downloaded and installed. If you encounter any errors at that stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly running M-x package-refresh-contents before doing so.
